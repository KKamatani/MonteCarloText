<div class="solution">

<div class="remark">
 <span class="remark"><em>Remark. </em></span> 記号<span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span>を使うのは，事後分布を計算するために不要な計算を回避する，計算のテクニックである．計算をこのように適宜省かないと，事後分布の計算はとても煩雑になりがちだからだ．
しかし，初学者は記号<span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span>の意味するものが well-defined ではないと感じることだろう．そのため，初学者は教科書に最初に紹介した，記号<span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span>をもちいずきっちり事後分布の確率密度関数を計算する方法を何度か経験したほうが良い．その経験のあとなら記号<span class="math inline">\(\propto\)</span>の便利さと意味を納得できるだろう．
</div>

<div class="exercise">

    &amp;\propto \tau^{N/2}\exp\left(-\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{(x_n-\mu)^2}{2}\tau\right)
\end{align*}\]</span>
となる．よって事後密度関数は
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    p(\tau|x^N)\propto \tau^{\alpha+N/2-1}\exp\left(-\left\{\beta+\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{(x_n-\mu)^2}{2}\right\}\tau\right)

となる．よって事後密度関数の形から，事後分布は
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{G}\left(\alpha+\frac{N}{2}, \beta+\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{(x_n-\mu)^2}{2}\right). \]</span>
</div>

<div class="remark">
 <span class="remark"><em>Remark. </em></span> 確率分布を求めよ，という問題は，求めるべき確率分布がよく知られた確率分布になることを暗に意味している．その確率分布が正規分布やガンマ分布など，どの確率分布なのか，そしてパラメータの値がなにかということが聞かれているのである．

 <span class="remark"><em>Remark. </em></span> ここでは
<span class="math display">\[p(\theta_2|x,\theta_1)\propto p(\theta_1,\theta_2|x) \]</span>

であり，<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>で条件つけた分布を計算する際には左辺の分母を定数と見て良いからだ．この考え方は，あとでギブスサンプリングを構成する際に重要である．

<div class="remark">
<p> <span class="remark"><em>Remark. </em></span> ディリクレ分布は和が<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>になる正の数列<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1,\ldots, \theta_K\)</span>に値を取る確率分布である．とくに<span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span>としたときがベータ分布である．和をとると<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>になる列は多項分布の確率関数になるから，ディリクレ分布は確率分布の確率分布とも捉えられる．うえの練習問題はこの事実を使った．</p>
ベータ分布は<span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span>であり，<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1+\theta_2=1\)</span>となるので，<span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>さえわかれば<span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>もわかるので確率密度関数を描画するのもたやすい．だから，ベータ分布のパラメータがベータ分布にどのように影響するかをみることも容易である．それに比べると，<span class="math inline">\(K\ge 3\)</span>のディリクレ分布の形状の把握は難しい．ここでは<span class="math inline">\(K=3\)</span>の場合を考えてみよう．じつは
<span class="math display">\[X_1\sim\mathcal{G}(\alpha_1,1),\ldots, X_K\sim\mathcal{G}(\alpha_K,1)\]</span>

<div class="exercise">
<span id="exr:unnamed-chunk-23" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 1.10  </strong></span>例1.14を参考に，実数<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, 正の実数<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>による正規分布<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>に対するジェフリーズ事前分布を計算したい．パラメータを<span class="math inline">\(\theta=(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>としたときのジェフリーズ事前分布をフィッシャー情報行列の計算による方法と，不変性を用いた方法の二通りの方法で求めよ．
</div>

<div class="solution">
<p> <span class="solution"><em>Solution. </em></span> <span class="math inline">\(\xi=\sigma^2\)</span>とおく．すると正規分布<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(\mu,\xi)\)</span>の確率密度関数は
<span class="math display">\[\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi\xi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\xi}(x-\mu)^2\right)\]</span>
である．だからスコア関数は
<span class="math display">\[\begin{matrix}S_1\\S_2\end{matrix}:=\begin{pmatrix}\xi^{-1}(x-\mu)\\-\frac{1}{2\xi}+\xi^{-2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2}\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
となる．いっぽう，例1.14で紹介したように，
<span class="math display">\[\mathbb{E}[x-\mu]=\mathbb{E}[(x-\mu)^3]=0,\ \mathbb{E}[(x-\mu)^2]=\xi,\ \mathbb{E}[(x-\mu)^4]=3\xi^2\]</span>
となる．したがって，フィッシャー情報行列は
<span class="math display">\[\mathbb{E}\left[\begin{pmatrix}S_1^2&amp;S_1S_2\\S_2S_1&amp;S_2^2\end{pmatrix}\right]=\begin{pmatrix}\xi^{-1}&amp;0\\0&amp;\xi^{-2}/2\end{pmatrix}\]</span>
である．この行列の行列式は<span class="math inline">\(\xi^{-3}/2\)</span>となるから，パラメータを<span class="math inline">\((\mu,\xi)\)</span>としたときのジェフリーズ事前分布は
<span class="math display">\[2^{-1/2}\xi^{-3/2}\]</span>
を密度関数として持つ．これでひとつめの直接的な方法でのジェフリーズ事前分布を導出できた．</p>
いっぽう，例1.14では<span class="math inline">\(\tau=\xi^{-1}\)</span>としてパラメータを<span class="math inline">\((\mu,\xi)\)</span>としたときのジェフリーズ事前分布が
<span class="math display">\[\tau^{-1/2}\]</span>
を密度関数として持つことがわかっている．また
<span class="math display">\[(\mu,\tau)\mapsto (\mu,\xi)\]</span>
という変数変換による<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ヤコビ行列">ヤコビ行列式</a>は
<span class="math display">\[\left|\det\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;-\xi^{-2}\end{pmatrix}\right|=\xi^{-2}\]</span>
である．よってジェフリーズ事前分布の変数変換による不変性から，パラメータを<span class="math inline">\((\mu,\xi)\)</span>としたときのジェフリーズ事前分布は
<span class="math display">\[\xi^{1/2}~\xi^{-2}=\xi^{-3/2}\]</span>
となり，たしかにさきほど求めたものと一致する （注: 次のRemark を見よ）．
</div>

<div class="remark">
 <span class="remark"><em>Remark. </em></span> この例のジェフリーズ事前分布のように非正則な分布に対しては，密度関数の定数倍の差は無視して良い．このことを，非正則な分布は定数倍の任意性があるとも言う．
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<p><span id="exr:unnamed-chunk-26" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 1.11  </strong></span><span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>は正の整数，<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1,\lambda_2\)</span>は正の実数とする．
<span class="math inline">\(x_1^1,\ldots, x_N^1|\lambda_1\sim\mathcal{P}(\lambda_1)\)</span>，
<span class="math inline">\(x_1^2,\ldots, x_N^2|\lambda_2\sim\mathcal{P}(\lambda_2)\)</span>であり
すべて独立とする．二つのモデル
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{M}_1:\lambda_1,\lambda_2\sim \mathcal{E}(1), \mathcal{M}_0:\lambda_1=\lambda_2\sim\mathcal{E}(1)\]</span>
を考える．二つのモデルへの事前確率は<span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>ずつとする．</p>
<p>(a). モデル<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_0\)</span>の事後確率を求めよ．</p>
<p>(b). ベイズ因子<span class="math inline">\(B_{10}\)</span>を求めよ．</p>
</div>

<div class="solution">
<p> <span class="solution"><em>Solution. </em></span> 例1.15でつかった<span class="math inline">\(x^N\)</span>や<span class="math inline">\(x_1^N, x_2^N\)</span>といった記号を再利用したうえで，さらに記号をいくつか用意しよう．各集団の和をそれぞれ
<span class="math display">\[S_1=\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n^1,\ S_2=\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n^2\]</span>
とし，全体の和を
<span class="math display">\[S=S_1+S_2\]</span>
とする．また，各集団の積をそれぞれ
<span class="math display">\[T_1=x_1^1\cdots x_N^1,\ T_2=x_1^2\cdots x_N^2\]</span>
とし，全体の積を
<span class="math display">\[T=T_1+T_2\]</span>
としよう．すると，モデル<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_1\)</span>のもとの周辺事後確率密度関数は
<span class="math display">\[p(x^N|1)=\int_0^\infty p(x_1^N|\lambda_1)p(\lambda_1)\mathrm{d}\lambda_1\times \int_0^\infty p(x_2^N|\lambda_2)p(\lambda_2)\mathrm{d}\lambda_2\]</span>
となる．うえの２つの積分の積のうち，最初の一つは
<span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty\frac{\lambda_1^{S_1}}{T_1}e^{-N\lambda_1}~e^{-\lambda_1}\mathrm{d}\lambda_1=\frac{\Gamma(1+S_1)}{T_1(N+1)^{1+S_1}}\]</span>
と計算できる．２つ目の積についても同じ計算をすれば
<span class="math display">\[\int_0^\infty\frac{\lambda_2^{S_2}}{T_2}e^{-N\lambda_2}~e^{-\lambda_2}\mathrm{d}\lambda_2=\frac{\Gamma(1+S_2)}{T_2(N+1)^{1+S_2}}\]</span>
となることがわかる．よってモデル<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_1\)</span>のもとの周辺事後確率密度関数は
<span class="math display">\[p(x^N|1)=\frac{\Gamma(1+S_1)\Gamma(1+S_2)}{T(N+1)^{2+S}}\]</span>
となる．まったく同じ計算で，モデル<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_0\)</span>の場合は
<span class="math display">\[p(x^N|0)=\int_0^\infty\frac{\lambda_1^{S}}{T}e^{-2N\lambda}~e^{-\lambda}\mathrm{d}\lambda=\frac{\Gamma(1+S)}{T(2N+1)^{1+S}}\]</span>
を得る．したがって
<span class="math display">\[\frac{p(x^N|0)}{p(x^N|1)}=\frac{(N+1)^{2+S}}{(2N+1)^{1+S}}\binom{S}{S_1}\]</span>
となる．よって</p>
<p>(a). 事後確率は
<span class="math display">\[\frac{(N+1)^{2+S}}{(2N+1)^{1+S}}\binom{S}{S_1}\left(1+\frac{(N+1)^{2+S}}{(2N+1)^{1+S}}\binom{S}{S_1}\right)^{-1}\]</span>.</p>
(b). ベイズ因子は
<span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{(N+1)^{2+S}}{(2N+1)^{1+S}}\binom{S}{S_1}\right)^{-1}.\]</span>
